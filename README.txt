FEATURES:

Database:
Having a database in the background leads to higheer expansibility for
future projects and is better for data tracking.

Sorting Algorithm:
** vinitha's little blurb **

GUI Interface:
We decided to be able to read in the user's input on how big/small they
wanted their group size to be.
We also wanted the user to be able to specify a CSV file if they already
had the data instead of forcing them to manually input the data.
** if filename cannot be inputted, you must name file ______ **
